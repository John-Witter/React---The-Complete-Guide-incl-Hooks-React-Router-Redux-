# [Quiz 3: Learning Check: Outputting Lists & Conditional Content](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?tab=rc)

## Question 1:
    What does this code snippet do?
    
```someArray.map((element) => <p>{element}</p>)```

    1. It's a special React syntax that tells React to loop through a list of 
        elements and output some JSX code.

    2. It transforms an array (someArray) into a new array full of JSX elements
        (which can be output by React).

    3. It tells React to output this paragraph conditionally.

### Answer:
    2. It transforms an array (someArray) into a new array full of JSX elements
        (which can be output by React).


## Question 2:
    Why should you add the special "key" prop to list JSX elements?

    1. It's required for React to be able to loop through the elements.

    2. It's required for the map() method to work correctly.
    
    3. It's required for React to correctly identify and update (if needed) the
        list elements.

### Answer:
    3. It's required for React to correctly identify and update (if needed) the
        list elements.

    * It's a unique identification criteria for every element.


## Question 3:
    What's true about outputting conditional content in React components?

    1. You need a special conditional content syntax in your JSX code.

    2. You need to create multiple, alternative components from which React chooses.

    3. You can work with regular ternary expressions of if checks to output or
        return different results in / from your components.

### Answer:
    3. You can work with regular ternary expressions of if checks to output or
        return different results in / from your components.
