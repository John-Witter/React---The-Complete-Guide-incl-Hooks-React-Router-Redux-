Add a new component, ExpenseFilter, which lets you filter by year from 2019-2022 from a drop-down

Use given styling, markup, and basic js

Challenge to you:
* listen to changes on the drop-down
* when a user selects a new year (state) listen and forward the year to the Expenses component and in Expenses, store the picked year in a state
* render ExpenseFilter in Expenses,
